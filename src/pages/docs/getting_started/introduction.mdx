# Introduction

**Intentify** is a website developed for Brave's Web-scraping for Visitor Classification Mini-challenge, combining both AI and webscraping to classify users based on their inputted URL.
Additionally, Intentify allows users to search for related webpages to their URL, helping users find what they are looking for and enhancing Intentify's predictions.
